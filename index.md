[Foundation for Environmental Monitoring (ffem)](http://ffem.io), is a [nonprofit (Section 8) company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-profit_laws_of_India#Section-8_Company) based in Bangalore, India.

We create products that are [Open Source](https://github.com/foundation-for-environmental-monitoring), inexpensive, and designed for field use. Our products are usually integrated with apps that post test results to online databases. We encourage results being posted as Open Data.

Elements of our work begain 2012 as [Ternup Research Labs](http://ternup.com). In 2014, our team merged with [Akvo](http://akvo.org). ffem was set up as a spinoff in June 2017. This [post](http://akvo.org/blog/akvo-spins-off-environmental-sensor-organisation-ffem/) explains the context and future directions.
