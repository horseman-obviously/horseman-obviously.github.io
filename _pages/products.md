ffem test devices are [open source](http://github.com/foundation-for-environmental-monitoring). They are designed for field use. Typically, ffem tests cost much less than a laboratory test, while they are a lot more precise than a field test kit.

### Working principle
Current test devices are based on colorimetry. The kits use the camera and flash of a smartphone to detect a colour change created by certain specific reagents. The colour change is compared to a series of calibrated colours and a suitably interpolated result is displayed.

The test method for Fluoride was published in a peer reviewed journal [Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716301553) [PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716301553/pdfft?md5=856d76c66ddd9f37e23c10ae0f159e92&pid=1-s2.0-S0048969716301553-main.pdf). All other tests work on the same principle.

### Caddisfly
The product may sometimes be referred to as Caddisfly, ffem Caddisfly, ffem Water or ffem soil.
