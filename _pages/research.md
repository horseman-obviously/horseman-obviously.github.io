### Inorganic water parameters
ffem has developed a test for Arsenic III, the more toxic form of Arsenic. Current research is focused on a simple test to develop a test for Total Arsenic.

Research is also underway to add tests for
* Alkalinity
* Total Hardness

### Coliforms / Fecal Coliforms in water
ffem has developed a proof-of-concept device that detects coliforms or fecal coliforms in 2 to 8 hours. The time taken for the test is a measure of the starting count of bacteria - a highly contaminated sample will take a shorter time. The 8 hour limit is for 1 CFU (Colony Forming Unit) in a 100 ml sample.

ffem is also working on a 1 to 2 hour test for coliforms and fecal coliforms. This test will rely on convolutional neural networks to detect specific bacteria. Currently this test has a laboratory prototype.

### Soil Nutrients
Research is underway to add secondary nutrients - Sulphur (S), Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), and minor nutrients - Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn), Molybdenum (Mo),
Boron (B), Chlorine (Cl), to the soil test kit.
